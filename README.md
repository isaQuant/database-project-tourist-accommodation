# tourist_accommodation_project

This project represents a database application for a fictitious regional booking platform. 

Every tourist accommodation has a name, adress, contact data (phone, email, fax, website), accommodation type (hotel, guesthouse, apartment, cottage) and possible social media accounts. If the tourist accommodation is a hotel, its number of stars is also known.

A tourist accommodation offers one or multiple categories. Every category has a name, description, number of beds and its floor area in squaremeters. 
A tourist accommodation has entities. Each entity belongs to exact one category and has a name (like room 23). This name is only per tourist accommodation unique. 

For each category the prices must be recorded.
